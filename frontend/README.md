# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file to your Gemini API key. Without it, AI features will emit warnings and return fallback responses.
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
